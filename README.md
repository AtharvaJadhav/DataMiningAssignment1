Part 1: Using CRISP-DM methodology on a Netflix dataset

In this analysis, I have chosen the famous dataset of "Netflix titles", and have tried to use the CRISP-DM methodology on the same. Beginning with an in-depth understanding of the dataset, we proceeded to clean and preprocess the data, ensuring its readiness for analysis. Through feature selection, our helpful junior data scientist "GPT4" pinpointed potential key attributes that offered valuable insights, which paved the way for our clustering exercise. By grouping similar titles, we used unsupervised learning to create a basic recommendation system. The analysis showed interesting patterns within Netflix's content library, showcasing the potential of data-driven insights in the streaming domain. Wrote a

Part 2: Demonstrating various usecases of Github Copilot alongside gpt-engineer

In the second part of the assignment, I used a tool called GitHub Copilot with Visual Studio Code. I made a video showing how this tool helps in writing, improving, and testing code. It's like having a smart assistant that suggests how to write the code better. I've saved all the code examples in this GitHub repository. Giving gpt-engineer the prompt "Build a temperature converter app. Use python and display output on terminal. Allow users to convert between Celcius and Fahrenheit." we made a simple python program to convert temperatures Celcius and Fahrenheit. We asked copilot to add code for Kelvin. Then we asked it to refactor the same code to use all the three temperatures interchangibly. At last, we asked it to write unit tests for the same. It works like magic!

I have uploaded the code in the "Part2" folder. Here's the screencast of the same with public access - [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OpOUvhiF694vTuprclIv5uXniP0oirM-?usp=sharing]
